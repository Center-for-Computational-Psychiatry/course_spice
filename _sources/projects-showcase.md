We hope you will be able to apply the skills and knowledge from this crash course to your research projects this summer! Please reach out via email with any questions pertaining to the content covered in this course.

In this section, we would love to include any outputs that you would like to showcase at the end of the program! It is completely optional, but we would love to see what you have done with the skills you have learned in the past 8 weeks.
