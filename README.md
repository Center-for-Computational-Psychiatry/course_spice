# Summer Program in Computational Psychiatry Education

Welcome to the [Summer Program in Computational Psychiatry Education (SPICE)](https://www.neurocpu.org/spice)! This GitHub repository contains a collection of course materials and resources designed for high school and undergraduate students interested in exploring the field of computational psychiatry and neuroscience.

SPICE is an educational initiative aimed at introducing high school and college students to the intersection of computer science and psychiatry. Students participate in an eight-week program that combines educational tutorials and hands-on research projects within laboratories at the Center for Computational Psychiatry in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.


## Education Track

The Education Track consists of two parallel components in a self-guided, two-week crash course format. Students will complete both to gain a preliminary understanding of computational psychiatry and neuroscience for application to their research projects. Please visit our Jupyter Book to navigate through the course materials: https://center-for-computational-psychiatry.github.io/course_spice/

### (1) Fundamentals of Computational Psychiatry and Neuroscience

This component provides students with an introduction to computational psychiatry and neuroscience. Students will participate in lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities. The primary aim of this course is to provide students with a basic understanding of computational psychiatry and neuroscience concepts for application to their research project.

This course will cover the relationship between the brain, behavior, and cognition. We will begin with foundational neuroanatomy and physiology, building towards an understanding of complex cognitive processes. We will analyze how disruptions in neural processes can lead to neurological and psychiatric disorders. Research methods used in neuroscience will be covered, with a focus on computational psychiatry and how it complements and diverges from traditional approaches.

| Computational Psychiatry and Neuroscience | Description | Slides |

| Class 8 - Metacognition | Exploration of higher cognitive functioning, specifically self-reflection and evaluation processes. | Available soon |
| Class 9 - Emotions and Social Decision Making | Examination of how cognitive processes, emotions, and social behavior interconnect, highlighting complex brain functions. | Available soon |

### (2) Fundamentals of Python Programming for Psychological and Neural Sciences

This component provides students with a hands-on introduction to Python programming for data analysis. Over the course of two weeks, students will use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) to learn the fundamentals of Python programming, basic data visualization techniques, and essential statistical analysis methods such as t-tests. The primary aim of this course is to develop practical coding skills and analytical tools to understand data, especially those within the fields of computational psychiatry and neuroscience.

The course begins with an introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Then, students will then dive into tutorials on Python basics (e.g., variables, data types, conditional statements, loops). As the course progresses, students will learn about data structures, reading and writing dataframes, and utilizing popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. They will also gain proficiency in descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and analyzing relationships between variables. The course culminates with a project in which students will apply these skills to analyze data from their research project.

Please see below for the list of modules within this course.
