    "<p>The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at <a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\">Project Jupyter</a>.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project, which used to have an IPython Notebook project itself. The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which allows you to write your programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that you can also use.</p>\n",

    "For a more complete answer, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/CSkTJRNBTME). The short answer is that a Jupyter notebook is an interactive tool that allows you to take notes, execute code, create figures, and easily share it all with other people. Jupyter notebooks comprise a series of _cells_. Each cell (looks like a rectangular block of text) in a notebook contains one of two basic categories of content:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Jupyter Notebooks to interface with Python. Rather than keeping code scripts code and execution separate, Jupyter integrates both together using the concept of cells. Two main types of cells are **code cells** and **markdown cells**. Cells pair \"snippets\" of code with the output obtained from running them and can contain plots/figures inline alongside code required to generate them."

    "| Code cells contain actual code that you want to run. You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook. Otherwise, you can hit esc and then y (denoted \"esc, y\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell. Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it. If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"shift + enter\". Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them. That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit \"shift + enter\" is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are now known to the Python interpreter. | Markdown cells (like the current cell) contain formatted text in the Markdown text formatting language. You can read about its syntax here. You can use these cells kind of like the code underlying text you'd write in a word processor. For the most part, text in Markdown cells gets \"rendered\" (i.e. drawn on the screen) just as you write it. However, you can also specify various formatting tweaks, like creating italicized or bolded text, etc. This tutorial provides a quick and gentle interactive introduction to Markdown. You can create a new Markdown cell by pressing the \"+\" button in the toolbar and selecting \"Markdown\" from the dropdown list in the toolbar. Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. Hitting \"shift + enter\" renders the text in the formatting you specify. You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting \"esc, m\" in the cell. Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode. |\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar. The shortcut to insert a cell below is \"*esc, b*\" and to insert a cell above is \"*esc, a*\". Alternatively, you can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting \"*alt + enter*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The text you type into a new notebook cell is a set of instructions that tell the notebook what to do when the cell is _run_ (i.e., transformed from a set of instructions into an executed set of actions).  To run a cell, hold the `shift` key and press `enter/return`.\n",
    "  - When you run a Markdown cell, the text is rendered with the formatting options you specify.  To see and/or edit the underlying code, simply double click on the rendered text.\n",
    "  - When you run a Code cell, the Python instructions you type in are run. We'll explore what this means below. Note: the first time you run a Code cell in Google Colaboratory, you'll see a warning message pop up (asking if it's okay to run code not authored by Google). You should give the notebook permission to run so that you can interact with it."

    "If you're accessing this notebook within Google Colaboratory, you can interact with Code by running it on Google's computers (via Google Cloud-- i.e., Google's high performance computing cluster).  The first time you run a command within a colaboratory notebook, you'll automatically be allocated a virtual computer (i.e., a simulation of a computer that's running somewhere on Google's servers).  It takes a few seconds to boot that system up (you'll see a \"connecting\" message in the upper right when the new computer is being allocated, and you'll see a bar graph showing RAM and disk usage once the computer is ready).  This all happens automatically (there's nothing you need to \"do\" in order to set up one of these virtual computers, aside from view and interact with the notebook in Google Colaboratory).\n",
