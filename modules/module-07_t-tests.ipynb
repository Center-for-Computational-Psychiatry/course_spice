    "Now that we have basics of Python syntax, data processing, and data visualization down, we can move on to hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is a way to test whether a certain effect is present in a population. For example, we might want to test whether a certain drug is effective in treating a psychiatric condition. We can do this by comparing the mean of a certain measure (e.g., symptom severity) in a group of people who took the drug to the mean of the same measure in a group of people who did not take the drug (a good design would also used a [randomized control trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6235704/) for group selection). If the mean of the measure is significantly lower in the group that took the drug, we can conclude that the drug is effective in treating the condition.\n",

    "We will apply this framework to compare means of two groups using [independent samples t-tests](https://www.pythonfordatascience.org/independent-samples-t-test-python/)."

    "Recall our data from the visualizations module. We explored the relationship between Depression and Loneliness. We found that there was a positive correlation between the two variables: As Depression increased, Loneliness also increased. However, we did not test whether this relationship was statistically significant. An independent samples t-test will allow us to test whether the mean differences in Loneliness between the High and Low Depression groups are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `stats.ttest_ind()` function from the `scipy` package to perform the t-test. This function takes two arrays as input and returns the t-statistic and p-value. The t-statistic is a measure of the difference between the two groups relative to the variance within each group. The p-value is the probability of observing a difference between the two groups as large as the one we observed if the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two groups. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups."
